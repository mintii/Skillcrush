<div class="about-me">

        <h2> All About Me </h2>
        <p>
          Hello I'm <strong>Mintii</strong>! I'm 26 years old and I live in Ann Arbor, Michigan! I recently graduated from the University of Michigan where I studied Psychology. I currently live in a large student co-op which is a part of the <em>Inter-Cooperative Council</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I currently work as a customer service rep in a large online advertising company. I assist advertisers with their questions and concerns regarding their advertising accounts. I receive inbound calls and chats from all over the world.  I have lots of experience and understanding on Google products such as AdWords, Analytics, and Google Merchant Center.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am now looking for junior web development positions that focus on HTML, CSS, Javascrip, JQuery, and Ruby.
        </p>


        <h2>My Passions and Hobbies</h2>
        <div id="tea-image"><img      src="http://i.imgur.com/sEC7usy.gif" style="width:auto; height: 150px; border: solid 1px #37717B;"/></div>
        <p>
        I enjoy drinking tea, especially black and oolong. Tea is delicious and each type offers an amazing experience.
       </p>
        <h6> If you don't agree with me, then we need to visit a tea shop together!</h6>
        <p>
          I've been learning to crochet. I have completed hats, and a few scarves. I've been working on a blanket for a year, but that's taking a while to finish. I also know how to knit, but I prefer crochet (It's faster, and not as many tools to buy).
        </p>

       <h2>How did I get interested into web development?</h2>
         <p>
          As my experience grew at my current job, I realized there's a huge need in technology, especially a need to reach out to small businesses. My experience with small businesses show that their websites are hardly up to par with what is needed to excel and attract potential customers.
        </p>
       <p>
         I began to see great community groups pop up like <a href= "http://www.gdiannarbor.com/">Girl Develop It Ann Arbor</a>, that encourage women to learn and advance in technological careers. I began to turn my self-doubt into fuel that <em>this could actually work!</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            With the help of Girl Develop It Ann Arbor, I've learned many amazing skills so far.
        </p>

<ul class="gdiLearn"><strong>I have learned:</strong>
              <li>Creating my own WordPress blog </li>
              <li>HTML and CSS</li>
              <li>User Experience testing and research</li>
              <li>Git and Github</li>
              <li>Java </li>
</ul>
    <p>
           They deserve so much praise for the work they provide in our community. Girl Development actually has many many chapters around the whole United States! If you're reading this and feeling inspired, I recommend checking out which chapter is closest to you!

        <h2>Where do I see myself in 1 year?</h2>
        <p>
          I see myself working in a new career utilizing the skills I have been learning with Skillcrush and other online and offline sources. I see myself being in a work environment that's exciting, invigorating, and rewarding. I see myself continuing on through technology, learning more languages and skills!
